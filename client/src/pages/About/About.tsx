              weren&apos;t always a hostel booking website. I was bitten by the
              travel bug. My first backpacking trip was a chaotic mess of
              questionable hostels, and language barriers that had us resorting
              to charades. But amidst the mishaps, I discovered something
              magical: the camaraderie and connection found in travel
              experiences. That&apos;s when the idea sparked. I knew there had
              to be a better way for college students to find affordable, safe,
              and social hostels. We wanted to create a platform that captured
              the spirit of adventure and connection, without the unnecessary
              stress. So, I embarked on a new adventure - building{" "}

              </strong>
              . I poured my travel experiences, late nights coding, and
              countless cups of coffee into creating a website that catered
              specifically to college students. I wanted to make it easy to find
              hostels that weren&apos;t just a place to sleep, but a launchpad
              for exploring new cities, meeting fellow travellers, and forging
              friendships that last a lifetime. Today,

            <strong style={{ fontSize: "4rem" }}>&ldquo;</strong>The first taste
            of freedom at college quickly turned into a bitter pill for me. My
            excitement about living off-campus in a hostel soon fizzled out,
            replaced by frustration and a constant sense of unease. The place
            was a mess â€“ overflowing bins, questionable hygiene practices, and a
            lingering stench that clung to everything.
            <br />
            <br /> Then came the bills. The advertised rent was a sweet lie.
            Apparently, there was a &apos;middleman&apos; involved, someone who
            magically inflated the price by a good chunk. It felt like a
            betrayal, a blatant exploitation of wide-eyed freshmen like me.
            <br />
            <br /> But the real nightmare was the electricity. We had these
            pre-paid meters, and some of my &apos;dorm mates&apos;, bless their
            hearts, had a talent for burning through units like nobody&apos;s
            business. We&apos;d be plunged into darkness for hours, fumbling
            around with candles and flashlights to study â€“ not exactly the ideal
            college experience.
            <br />
            <br /> The commute wasn&apos;t any better. The road leading to the
            hostel was a dusty, potholed nightmare. Every ride felt like an
            off-road adventure, testing the limits of both our patience and the
            rickety rickshaw we usually shared.
            <br />
            <br /> And then there was the security, or rather, the complete lack
            of it. The flimsy locks on the doors were more symbolic than
            functional, and the &apos;night watchman&apos; seemed to spend most
            nights napping under a tree. We lived in constant worry about our
            belongings. <br />
            <br />
            These weren&apos;t just inconveniences; they were major roadblocks
            to a smooth college life. It was then, amidst the frustration and
            grime, that the idea for Duplex sparked. I knew there had to be a
            better way. Safe, clean, affordable hostels â€“ a dream for many
            college students, myself included.
            <br />
            <br /> Duplex wasn&apos;t just born from my own experience; it was
            born from the collective woes of countless students like me. We
            deserved better, and we were determined to create it. Transparent
            pricing, responsible power consumption, proper sanitation, and most
            importantly, security â€“ these were the pillars upon which we built
            Duplex. We wanted to create hostels that were more than just a place
            to crash; we wanted to build a community, a launchpad for amazing
            college adventures, free from the hassles that had plagued my first
            year.
            <br />
            <br /> So, here we are. Duplex â€“ a hostel experience built not just
            for college students, but by them. We understand the struggles, the
            needs, and the yearning for a place that feels like home, even when
            you&apos;re miles away from it. Join us, and let&apos;s rewrite the
            story of college hostel living, one clean, secure, and affordable
            stay at a time. Because every student deserves a great start to
            their college journey, and a hostel shouldn&apos;t be a hurdle, but
            a stepping stone.
